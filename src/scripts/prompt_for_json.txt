You have been provided with a Spring Boot code base that contains a controller, service, model with multiple methods, endpoints, and request mappings. Your task is to read the source code and document the key methods, endpoints, request mappings, and any important logic within this controller.

## Instructions 
1. Read the code annotations and comments to understand the purpose of the controller, service, and model.
2. Read the method definitions and call to understand the flow of the code.
3. If the class is controller include request mapping and if its other class request mapping must be nil with quotes.
4. Remove the method arguments just use () 
5. Do not include any java library functions here. Only include function name in function_calls not arguments
6. Convert the result into json format
7. JSON format should be in following format for the given java code
public class ShoppingCartController{
@GetMapping("/shoppingCart")
    public ModelAndView shoppingCart() {
        ModelAndView modelAndView = new ModelAndView("/shoppingCart");
        modelAndView.addObject("products", shoppingCartService.getProductsInCart());
        modelAndView.addObject("total", shoppingCartService.getTotal().toString());
        return modelAndView;
    }
}

[{
   "class": "ShoppingCartController",
   "method": "shoppingCart",
   "description": "This method is used to get the products in cart and total amount and return the view",
   "function_calls": ["shoppingCartService.getProductsInCart()", "shoppingCartService.getTotal().toString()"]
}]

function_calls must have class name followed by method name without arguments

now generate the json for all the methods in the given java code as below
